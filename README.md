ML Final Project Abstract

[Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster](https://www.openml.org/d/40945)

"The Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster" dataset found on Kaggle consists of information on people who were on the Titanic when it sank. Our data contains features such as age, sex, ticket class, and more. Our machine learning algorithm has used this information to accurately predict whether or not a passenger survived the sinking. Using the model, we can also test the survivability of "ghost" passengers. Would you have survived?
