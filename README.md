ML Final Project Abstract

Campus Recruitment Projections

The Campus Recruitment Database found on Kaggle, consists of students looking to get an entry-level job or internship during or directly following their undergraduate degree. The information contained includes fields such as prior work experiences, degree percentage, gender, etc. We will implement Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms in order to compare effectiveness for projecting college graduate acceptance into the job force. Based on the recruitment data, we will implement additional specifications that could lead to more relevant projections. By looking at the different algorithms implemented in this task, we hope to distinguish the best suited for our dataset. The best algorithm will be determined based on its efficiency and accuracy for predicting job force acceptance for college students.
